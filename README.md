# go_algorithmic_projects
go_algorithmic_projects is a repo containing the solutions to the Manning series 6 algorithmic projects in Go
Each file can be run as main, thus it is self-contained and there might be duplication of code to keep the folder structure simple.

Project 1 includes the implementations of some well known sorting and searching algorithms.
- bubblesort
- quicksort
- countingsort
- linear search
- binary search

Project 2 includes the implementations of some linked data structures (linear and nonlinear)
- singly linked list
- loops
- doubly linked list
- trees
- sorted BST

Project 3 includes the solutions to some well-known recursion problems
- factorials
- fibonacci
- dynamic fibonacci
- knight's tour
- N queens brute force

Project 4 includes code implementations for problems related to hashing

Project 5 includes code implementations of utilities for prime numbers and RSA
- gcd
- fast exponentiation
